Small Networks: Binomial For a small network (N = 102) the degree distribution deviates significantly from the Poisson form (3.8), as the condition for the Poisson approximation, N\u00bb\u2039k\u203a, is not satisfied. Hence for small networks one needs to use the exact binomial form (3.7) (green line). Large Networks: Poisson For larger networks (N = 103, 104) the degree distribution becomes indistinguishable from the Poisson prediction (3.8), shown as a continuous grey line. Therefore for large N the degree distribution is independent of the network size.

Hence for small networks one needs to use the exact binomial form (3.7) (green line). Large Networks: Poisson For larger networks (N = 103, 104) the degree distribution becomes indistinguishable from the Poisson prediction (3.8), shown as a continuous grey line.
